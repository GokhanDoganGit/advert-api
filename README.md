# Advert API Project

This project is designed to allow users to submit, manage, and modify the status of their adverts.
Users can enter the advert title, description, and category, and manage the status of these
adverts (Aktif, Deaktif, etc.).
This project is a POC for managing adverts.

## Project Purpose

- Users can submit adverts to the system, manage their statuses, and modify active or deactivated
  adverts.
- Adverts will transition between "Onay Bekliyor" and "Aktif" based on certain rules and timeframes.
- The API allows for statistical information about adverts and status changes to be retrieved.
- The project includes unit tests, containerization, and logging for performance monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11**
- **Spring Boot 2.7.18**
